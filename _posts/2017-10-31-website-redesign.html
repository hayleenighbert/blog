<p>In order to showcase more recent work, I started a portfolio page from scratch using Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and jQuery.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Initial Design Process</h2>

<p>First, I had to tackle the overall design of my web site and blog, and decide which techologies I want to implement for both. I decided to create my main portfolio and blog using the Bootstrap framework. In order to create the blog, I used Ruby and Jekyll to scaffold the UI for the blog posts. My portfolio was created using components built using CSS, HTML, and jQuery.</p>

<p>I created several component templates that could be used throughout the web site. Components included animation and interactive elements such as parallax.js and Bootstrap components.</p>


<p>In order to make an impactful portfolio web site, I knew I had to start minimalist and work my way up to more complicated features. I first made mockups in Sketch and Adobe XD, then implemented those design choices into the code base and published using Github Pages.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Imagery and Design</h2>

<p>I designed my own logo and used <a href="https://www.hayleenoellephotography.com/" target="_blank">photographs I took</a> for the finalized design of my portfolio.</p>
